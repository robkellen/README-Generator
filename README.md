## Description

This is a command-line application that allows users to quickly and easily generate a README that is tailored to their project.

## Installation

This application requires node.js and the Inquirer npm package. To install Inquirer from your terminal run: `npm install inquirer`
Visit [https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer#installation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer#installation) for additional options.

## Usage

To run the application simply enter `node index.js` in the command line, and answer the prompts with the information you want to be entered into your generated README. The title of the generated README file will be "README-Test.md" but you can change the name prior to running the application by editing line 20 of the index.js file.
